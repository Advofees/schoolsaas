# Plan
- Majority of Kenyan schools teachers struggle to manage the admin stuff as classes are overcrowded
- Most of the fees paid by parents are cash
- School registers are physical
- Schools are underfunded to afford existing solutions
- Government has tried to modernize and bring tech but has since failed

- The solution can be a basic crud app for the most mundane day to day activities of a teacher i.e daily roll call, registrations, grade management, lesson planning, fee management, reports generation, results analysis

- got 1 schools with over 1500 kids which would love such a system which would big help for the teachers
- existing solutions charge all the way from 2K per kid per term making them unfordable for most schools and parents
